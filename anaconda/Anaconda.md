Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda?
This will activate conda on startup and change the command prompt when activated.

If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup, run the following command when conda is activated:

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

You can undo this by running `conda init --reverse $SHELL`? [yes|no]




This message is prompted during the Anaconda installation process and relates to configuring your shell environment (e.g., Bash, Zsh) to automatically initialize Conda when you start a new terminal session.

Here's a breakdown:
1. **Automatic Initialization of Conda:**
   - If you choose "yes," Conda will be automatically initialized whenever you start a new terminal session. This means the Conda base environment will be activated by default.
2. **Conda Base Environment Activation:**
   - Activating Conda's base environment means that when you open a new terminal, it'll start with Conda activated, and you'll see `(base)` or similar in your command prompt to indicate the active Conda environment.
3. **Option to Avoid Auto-Activation:**
   - If you prefer not to activate the Conda base environment by default when starting a new terminal, choose "no." This prevents Conda from automatically activating its base environment.
4. **Manual Activation (if auto-activation is off):**
   - Even if you choose "no," you can still activate Conda manually by typing `conda activate base` or activate another environment as needed.
5. **Adjusting Auto-Activation Later:**
   - If you initially choose "yes" and later want to deactivate the auto-activation, you can use the command `conda config --set auto_activate_base false`.
6. **Reversing Initialization:**
   - If you ever want to reverse all changes made by the initialization script, you can use `conda init --reverse $SHELL`.

Your decision here affects whether Conda's base environment is automatically activated when you start a new terminal session. Choose "yes" if you want automatic activation or "no" if you prefer manual activation or if you're not sure yet.




You have chosen to not have conda modify your shell scripts at all.
To activate conda's base environment in your current shell session:
```bash
eval "$(/home/vladimir/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.YOUR_SHELL_NAME hook)" 
```


To install conda's shell functions for easier access, first activate, then:

```bash
conda init
```

Thank you for installing Anaconda3!
